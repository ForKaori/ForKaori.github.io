## Dogecoin Market Analytics

The project was using Big Data analytics knowledge I have learned in CS courses to analyze cryptocurrency market.

As Bitcoin is discovered thoroughly, my teammate and I decided to analyze Dogecoin instead. I have retrieved data using **Nasdaq Data Link API**, combined with **GCP BigQuery** and **PySpark** to perform analysis. 

Suprisingly, we have found some addresses with abnormal behaviour. You can find the analysis **[here](https://github.com/ForKaori/dogecoin-analytics/blob/30e190fea9a0b5daf3f9d8aee02572721f9b5f39/Project.ipynb)**

## Interactive Chess Game

The project was done in group of three. My teammates and I have developed a full chess game from scratch using **C++** entirely.

We have developed user interfaces to support PvP games. Meanwhile, we have also developed four different levels of AI to support PvE games.

You can ask me for source code if you are interested in.

## Mini Compiler for C-like language

I have developed a mini-compiler based on **C++** from scratch which translates high-level simplified C language to assembly language and then machine code.

You can ask me for source code if you are interested in.
