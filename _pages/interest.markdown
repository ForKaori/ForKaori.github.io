## Drawing

I spent three years learning sketch when I was in primary school and middle school. However, due to
the exams I stopped that for a long time.  

If I'm not learning CS or Math in university, maybe...  

Right now I just draw random pictures (mostly are characters from animes). You can find some of my drawing on [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/users/42788636).

I started to watch animes when I entered college. You can find my anime list on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/55875820/bangumi).  

Here is the top six animes I've ever seen in my anime list, I will update when I see a better one.
